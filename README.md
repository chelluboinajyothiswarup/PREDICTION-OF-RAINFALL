# PREDICTION-OF-RAINFALL
This project is based on to predict whether it would rain tomorrow or not by using Ensembling models.<br>
Here, I have taken a rainfall dataset of weather in various cities of Australia.<br>
I have selected RandomForest algorithm,XGBoost algorithm and Catboost algorithm for my prediction.<br>
I have created a GUI which would predict whether it would rain by the giving the requried parameters.<br>
